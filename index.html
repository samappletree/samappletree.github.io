While I mainly specialize in Human – Computer Interaction, I also have a passion for User Experience, Software Design and Project Management. When I’m not attempting to keep up with the latest design trends and improve my programming skills, you can find me exploring social media sites or on the beach reading a book (I’m currently reading the King Killer Chronicles, feel free to ask me about it). </p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Application</h2>
            <hr class="white_theme">
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>As part of a class project, we had the opportunity to work for a real world client. My group built a data visualization application that allowed users to tell their data stories using a notebook style format. In this project, I acted as the UI/UX designer and created all the mockups for the project that are pictured below.</p>

            <h2>Site Map</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/sitemap.png" />
            <p>Above is a diagram representing the sitemap for DVA. Users start off at the main welcome page of our site and are led to a login where they can also sign up if they are new users. They then get the option of where they want to go next, whether that be the workspace where they can create visualizations by importing their own data, or to a gallery page where they can either see their own visualizations or a public gallery where they can explore other users’ visualizations. There is also a help page where there will be a user manual to give them guidance and understanding of the site. They are also given a settings drop down bar that will lead users to either their account information or to a preferences page where they will be able to change a few of the preferences in regards to their workspace.</p> 

            <h2>User Manual Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/usermanual.png" />
            <p>This is the “Help” page and the users can reach this page by clicking on the “Help” on the upper right hand corner. The Help page or User manual page is a page requested specifically from the project sponsor in wanting a sort of user guide that gives instructions or help on how to fully utilize the site. This page can be accessed through the appropriate tab/link once a user has logged into an account. </p>

            <h2>Welcome Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/welcomepage.png" />
            <p>This mockup represents the welcome page of our site, this is the first page a user will see when they first enter the site. From here they have the options of being able to access the public gallery, the help page as well as login or sign up if they are a brand new user of the site. By clicking on “Sign up here” the user will go on a new screen and be able to make their account.</p>
            <h2>Sign up Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/signup.png" />
            <p>This is the “Sign up” page, the user can reach this page from the Welcome page by clicking “Sign up”.  This is the first step for a user to make their account for this application. The user enters their email, first and last name, and password. By clicking the “Sign up” button the user will be taken directly to the Import file/Saved projects page and be able to begin making their visualizations.</p>

            <h2>Sign in Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/signin.png" />
            <p>For those who already have an account they can directly go on to the Sign in page from the Welcome page by clicking on the “Login” on the upper right hand corner of the Welcome Page. This action leads the user to this page, the “Sign In” page. Here the user enters their email, and password. By clicking the “Login” button the user will be taken directly to the Import file/Saved projects page and be able to begin making their visualizations.</p>

            <h2>My Account Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/account.png" />
            <p>This is a mockup of the “My Account” page. Once a user has logged into their account, they can access and change their settings as needed. Users can easily toggle the drop down menu by clicking the “Settings” drop down menu. Here they have the option to look at their account information, change preferences as needed, or logout of the site in this drop down menu.</p>

            <h2>Main Workspace Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/workspace.png" />
            <p>This is our main workspace page of our site. The users can reach this screen by clicking on “Workspace” tab of the site. This is where users can create and edit the visualization of their choice based on the data set they choose to work with. The new workspace page is a notebook style, where users can add (append buttons), edit(little pencil button), move up and down(up and down arrows), minimize(arrows facing each other) and remove( the ‘x’ button) cells.  To start, users can press the “Append Data” button, where they have the option to copy and paste a data set of their choice in either a ‘CSV’ or ‘JSON’ file type. They can also  name their data set here and view a few rows of their data set presented in a nice table format. By adding a markdown cell using the “Append Markdown” button, users can add text and pictures in order to help tell stories and explain the data or visualizations as needed. A transform cell, which can be added by using the “Append Transformation” button, lets users edit and transform their data by writing specific code to create new functions and transform the data. In a visualization cell, users create and edit visualizations based on their data or transformation cells and what type of visualization they want to do.</p>

            <h2>Public/My Gallery Pages</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/gallery.png"/>
            <p>This mockup represents a view of what the gallery pages will look like. This is where users will be able to view all of the the visualizations they have already made. They will have the option of being able to look at a public gallery where all users can share with other users the visualizations they have made through our site. Users can easily get to the “Public Gallery” page from almost any point of the site. However, the users “My Gallery” page may only be accessed once a user has logged into their account. A user can also click on the “Add Visualization” box, where they will be sent to the “Import File/Saved Projects” page so that they can begin the process of making a new visualization.</p>

            <p>In my Human-Computer Interaction Project class, my group was tasked with doing a usability evaluation and recommendations for our clients who created UCI's EEE Scout.</p>
            <p>EEE Scout is a web application for building forms, accepting submission of completed forms, and reviewing submissions. It was designed specifically for use in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) community. As it requires a UCInet identification to access the site, it is accessible only by UCI students, faculty, and staff.</p>
            <p>As both a group and indiviually, we completed lots of research, Individual User and Group Testing , Heurisics Evaluations, and Surveys. Once we completed all our research and evaluations, we created a report on our findings and included our final recommendations based on our research and testing.</p>

            <p> In my Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction class, our groups were allowed to choose one of our least favorite interfaces and do a complete set of Evaluation and Redeign for the Interface. My group choose the Anteater Express website.</p>
            <p>Anteater Express is the shuttles that drive around UCI's campus and some of the on-campus housing. Several members of my group including myself have lived in some of the on-campus housing communities and use the shuttles as way to get onto campus. Having personal experience with understanding how to ride the shuttles and figure out the difference between routes, we all found that the shuttle's website was not the greatest.</p>
            <p>In our deliverables, we used many different ways to evalute the site such as Heuristic Evaluations, Interviews, Personas, Scenarios, Use Cases and many more. After doing lots of evaluation exercises, we as a group did a redesign based on our observations and research of the usability of the site. In our redesigning process, we did storyboarding, sketching and created mockups.</p>

            				<p>A competitor analysis is a way of comparing what already exists out in the world with the type of product you are trying to build. For my portfolio, I focused on comparing the different portfolio websites that I have encountered, specifically the ones that had people who were interested in the same types of jobs I was looking at. Seeing what is out there and my "competition" helped me build a better site that helps me stand out compared to those I was researching.</p>

            				<p>A feature value matrix is a list of features being compared against each other based on their user value, business value, and development effort. My feature value matrix helped me to prioritize the features I wanted to include in my portfolio. For my portfolio, I wanted to focus on showcasing who I am and my skills and experiences. I also had wanted to make it easy for people to either find and connect with me on social media or send me a message without much effort on their part(hence the contact form).</p>

            				<p>SUser stories are real-life scenarios of how a specific kind of user may interact with your product or a certain feature. When I was creating my user stories, I thought about the main types of users who would be looking at my portfolio and what kind of information they would be focused on finding. For example, I thought about how the main purpose of my site is to help showcase my skills and expertise in order to get a job, which meant that my main audience would be Hiring managers or recruiters trying to gain insight into who I am and if my skills match those of what they are looking for.</p>

            				<p>A cognitive walkthrough is where you take a user and ask them to perform a series of tasks in order to observe how they interact with a product. This is a great way to see how real users interact with the product and if those interactions were that of what you expected or if they found the tasks difficult. While doing the walkthroughs for my own project was helpful in finding important bugs and general perceptions of my site, the biggest challenge I found was that I was only able to do the walkthroughs with fellow classmates due to time constraints when I would have preferred to have seen recruiters or hiring managers interactions and views of my portfolio.</p>

            				<p>For testing my portfolio with users, I decided to do two types of tests, click and question. The click test gives users a simple task to find a specific item and click where they think they would find that item. I had given my users the task of finding my skills, where the hope is that they would click on skills tab of my navigation bar.  For the other test, I did a question test, where users were asked questions about a specific task or piece of information. In my test, I asked users what kind of information they would expect to find on the page if they were a hiring manager. The responses to both tests helped me understand if my expectations for the interactions with my site were correct or not.</p>

            	<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
            	<p>Once I completed all of the user research and the user testing, I found that I gained lots of knowledge about portfolios, their meaning and expectations for certain groups of users, as well as problems or bugs in my own portfolio and some small fixes that I would want to change. In terms of better understanding my user's better as well as my competition, I had the opportunity to talk to several developers about not only what they do and where they are in their career but to gain an insight into understanding their expectations for a web portfolio. I found it interesting that the few people I was able to interview were at very different stages in their career and saw things in different lights. The students were very focused on trying to gain a job to start their career, while my career people were either looking for a promotion at their job or trying to bring in other people to help development. The one challenge I found with this was that I wasn't quite able to gain a recruiter or hiring manager's position on the subjects, I had reached out to a few that I knew but received no responses back. I think that if I had been able to gain at least one recruiter/hiring manager's response, I would have received a whole other perception on portfolios that I don't know about.</p>
            	<p>User testing, on the other hand, helped me to see where I needed to fix my own portfolio. I was lucky enough to have very honest friends to tell me what exactly they liked and didn't like about my site. Most of the feedback I received was positive, they liked the color scheme and the flow of the site, however, I was able to gain insight into where I needed improvements. There were a few bugs in my code that were very visible such as the background behind my modals would scroll. Or the navigation bar is a little wonky and off centered. There was one thing I realized after completing all of my user testings was that I was only testing my desktop version. I completely left out any testing on the mobile version of the site. I think that if I had tested with at least one user on the mobile version, I could gain better insight into what exactly needs to be fixed on the responsive end so that my site looks great not just on the desktop, but mobile and tablet as well.</p>

            	<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
            	<p>Like I had mentioned in my summary, most of the feedback I was received was very positive overall with good reactions to my site, but that doesn't mean there aren't still things that I would fix or change with my portfolio. In terms of small or minor fixes, I plan to adjust the spacing between the sections, while white space is great for design, based on the feedback, some of my sections had a little too much space. I also plan to stop the instance when the background behind my project's pop-up modals start scrolling. This scrolling issue is distracting and takes the user away from focusing on my project experience. Another fix I hope to implement is that of opening up the contact form character limit and getting rid of the natural text input box in order to make my site match itself better. I also plan to do some minor adjustments here or there that are more personal little fixes that I want to be fixed.</p>
            	<p>While there are several little fixes that I hope to make, there is one area that I believe needs a lot of work, my site's mobile responsiveness. I made the mistake of not testing the mobile version with users, but after taking a look myself I realized that the responsiveness of my site needs a lot of work. I had set up the basic structure for it, but there are lots of little details that need to be adjusted in order to make my site more appealing on mobile devices. For instance combining the navigation bar into a single drop down on mobile will help alleviate some of the awkward spacing it currently takes up. I also need to adjust the spacing and sizing of all my sections in order to help them fit better in the smaller setting of mobile devices. The mobile responsiveness needs a lot of help, and while I may not be able to finish it before the due date of this project, I do hope to find time in the immediate future to do the best I can with it.</p>
