While I mainly specialize in Human – Computer Interaction, I also have a passion for User Experience, Software Design and Project Management. When I’m not attempting to keep up with the latest design trends and improve my programming skills, you can find me exploring social media sites or on the beach reading a book (I’m currently reading the King Killer Chronicles, feel free to ask me about it). </p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Application</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>As part of a class project, we had the opportunity to work for a real world client. My group built a data visualization application that allowed users to tell their data stories using a notebook style format. In this project, I acted as the UI/UX designer and created all the mockups for the project that are pictured below.</p>

            <h2>Site Map</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/sitemap.png" />
            <p>Above is a diagram representing the sitemap for DVA. Users start off at the main welcome page of our site and are led to a login where they can also sign up if they are new users. They then get the option of where they want to go next, whether that be the workspace where they can create visualizations by importing their own data, or to a gallery page where they can either see their own visualizations or a public gallery where they can explore other users’ visualizations. There is also a help page where there will be a user manual to give them guidance and understanding of the site. They are also given a settings drop down bar that will lead users to either their account information or to a preferences page where they will be able to change a few of the preferences in regards to their workspace.</p> 

            <h2>User Manual Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/usermanual.png" />
            <p>This is the “Help” page and the users can reach this page by clicking on the “Help” on the upper right hand corner. The Help page or User manual page is a page requested specifically from the project sponsor in wanting a sort of user guide that gives instructions or help on how to fully utilize the site. This page can be accessed through the appropriate tab/link once a user has logged into an account. </p>

            <h2>Welcome Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/welcomepage.png" />
            <p>This mockup represents the welcome page of our site, this is the first page a user will see when they first enter the site. From here they have the options of being able to access the public gallery, the help page as well as login or sign up if they are a brand new user of the site. By clicking on “Sign up here” the user will go on a new screen and be able to make their account.</p>
            <h2>Sign up Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/signup.png" />
            <p>This is the “Sign up” page, the user can reach this page from the Welcome page by clicking “Sign up”.  This is the first step for a user to make their account for this application. The user enters their email, first and last name, and password. By clicking the “Sign up” button the user will be taken directly to the Import file/Saved projects page and be able to begin making their visualizations.</p>

            <h2>Sign in Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/signin.png" />
            <p>For those who already have an account they can directly go on to the Sign in page from the Welcome page by clicking on the “Login” on the upper right hand corner of the Welcome Page. This action leads the user to this page, the “Sign In” page. Here the user enters their email, and password. By clicking the “Login” button the user will be taken directly to the Import file/Saved projects page and be able to begin making their visualizations.</p>

            <h2>My Account Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/account.png" />
            <p>This is a mockup of the “My Account” page. Once a user has logged into their account, they can access and change their settings as needed. Users can easily toggle the drop down menu by clicking the “Settings” drop down menu. Here they have the option to look at their account information, change preferences as needed, or logout of the site in this drop down menu.</p>

            <h2>Main Workspace Page</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/workspace.png" />
            <p>This is our main workspace page of our site. The users can reach this screen by clicking on “Workspace” tab of the site. This is where users can create and edit the visualization of their choice based on the data set they choose to work with. The new workspace page is a notebook style, where users can add (append buttons), edit(little pencil button), move up and down(up and down arrows), minimize(arrows facing each other) and remove( the ‘x’ button) cells.  To start, users can press the “Append Data” button, where they have the option to copy and paste a data set of their choice in either a ‘CSV’ or ‘JSON’ file type. They can also  name their data set here and view a few rows of their data set presented in a nice table format. By adding a markdown cell using the “Append Markdown” button, users can add text and pictures in order to help tell stories and explain the data or visualizations as needed. A transform cell, which can be added by using the “Append Transformation” button, lets users edit and transform their data by writing specific code to create new functions and transform the data. In a visualization cell, users create and edit visualizations based on their data or transformation cells and what type of visualization they want to do.</p>

            <h2>Public/My Gallery Pages</h2>
            <img src="img/dva/gallery.png"/>
            <p>This mockup represents a view of what the gallery pages will look like. This is where users will be able to view all of the the visualizations they have already made. They will have the option of being able to look at a public gallery where all users can share with other users the visualizations they have made through our site. Users can easily get to the “Public Gallery” page from almost any point of the site. However, the users “My Gallery” page may only be accessed once a user has logged into their account. A user can also click on the “Add Visualization” box, where they will be sent to the “Import File/Saved Projects” page so that they can begin the process of making a new visualization.</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
            <img src="img/scout.png"/>
            <p>In my Human-Computer Interaction Project class, my group was tasked with doing a usability evaluation and recommendations for our clients who created UCI's EEE Scout.</p>
            <p>EEE Scout is a web application for building forms, accepting submission of completed forms, and reviewing submissions. It was designed specifically for use in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) community. As it requires a UCInet identification to access the site, it is accessible only by UCI students, faculty, and staff.</p>
            <p>As both a group and indiviually, we completed lots of research, Individual User and Group Testing , Heurisics Evaluations, and Surveys. Once we completed all our research and evaluations, we created a report on our findings and included our final recommendations based on our research and testing.</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
            <img src="img/aexpress.png" />
            <p> In my Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction class, our groups were allowed to choose one of our least favorite interfaces and do a complete set of Evaluation and Redeign for the Interface. My group choose the Anteater Express website.</p>
            <p>Anteater Express is the shuttles that drive around UCI's campus and some of the on-campus housing. Several members of my group including myself have lived in some of the on-campus housing communities and use the shuttles as way to get onto campus. Having personal experience with understanding how to ride the shuttles and figure out the difference between routes, we all found that the shuttle's website was not the greatest.</p>
            <p>In our deliverables, we used many different ways to evalute the site such as Heuristic Evaluations, Interviews, Personas, Scenarios, Use Cases and many more. After doing lots of evaluation exercises, we as a group did a redesign based on our observations and research of the usability of the site. In our redesigning process, we did storyboarding, sketching and created mockups.</p>
